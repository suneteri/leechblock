# leechblock
my custom blocklists and block page. you can get the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/).

**if you're looking to add custom pages, you need to whitelist leechblock's extension ID from firefox's security features so it's allowed to open local files.**
there is a guide on how to do so [here](https://github.com/fastaddons/GroupSpeedDial/issues/36#issuecomment-788283828).
