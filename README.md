# leechblock
my custom blocklists and block page. you can get the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/).

**if you're looking to use a custom block page that is hosted locally on your machine**, you need to [whitelist leechblock's extension ID from firefox's security features](https://github.com/fastaddons/GroupSpeedDial/issues/36#issuecomment-788283828).

## the filters
- [DOOMSCROLL LITE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneteri/leechblock/main/doomscroll-lite.txt) - sites i keep at a 30 minute time limit.
- [DOOMSCROLL STRICT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneteri/leechblock/main/doomscroll-strict.txt) - sites that are blocked 24/7.
